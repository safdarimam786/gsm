                    <p> Dear Parents and Students, In a world torn by conflicts and differences in social, economic and political realms, we must try to unlock new ways of viewing problems and open doors to a brand new world potentials, solutions and perceptions.
                        Notwithstanding Mark Twain's views on schooling, we firmly believe that schooling and education should be synonymous at least to the extent that schooling needs to be full of education. Education means all round development of human potential and personality—physical, mental, moral and spiritual. Education paves the path to knowledge and knowledge leads to wisdom. Merit and excellence should be our watchwords and service to humanity our motto. Besides academic excellence and intellectual development, Geeta Sanjay Memorial Public School endeavors to help each child discover and develop his/her innate talents and abilities. It seeks to instill in the children proper habits, positive attitudes and values such as honesty, unselfishness, self-respect, self-control, sense of duty, good spirit, dignity of labor, punctuality, compassion, freedom of mind and rational and scientific approach.</p>

                        <p>We agree with John F. Kennedy that, “We progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education.” We must remember that the human mind is our fundamental resource. Thus, it is essential that we work towards the maximum development of every young mind. Only then will we be able to address our requirements of world leadership, our hopes for economic grow, and our demands of able citizenship. The importance of education in the life of an individual cannot be overstated. It shapes individuals in their formative years and imbues them with values that would govern all their choices in life. It is said 'If you are planning tor a year, sow rice; you are planning for a decade, plant trees; If you are planning for a lifetime, educate people'. Indeed, one can even say that the quality of education will determine the destiny of the nation.</p>
                        <p>Geeta Sanjay Memorial Public School is fortunate to have an experienced and committed team which has brought the school to its present stature. I along with my team of silent workers and dedicated faculty intend to build on this strong foundation and raise the standards in all spheres, to the zenith. It is essential to get the ideas right, adopt them and correctly implement them with focus on reviewing them constantly in the spirit of innovation. Each passing year is a learning experience; it is an endless journey which opens up new vistas of development, where there is neither scope nor room for pettiness, disharmony, jealousy, hatred enmity or complacency. Hence, we must all rise above the rhetoric and endeavor to make the world a better place.</p>
